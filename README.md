# BitterEN

Bitter peptides are short amino acid sequences linked to bitterness, nutritional effects, and potential health benefits. Accurately identifying these peptides remains challenging despite increasing computational interest. In this study, we introduce BitterEN, a novel ensemble framework combining Gradient Boosting (GB) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. BitterEN achieved superior performance compared to existing approaches, reaching 0.995 accuracy using merged feature extractions with Random Forest (RF) feature selection. The model demonstrated strong generalization over repeated evaluations and is made available through a practical GitHub implementation. BitterEN may support future research in healthcare, nutritional science, and peptide-based therapeutics.
